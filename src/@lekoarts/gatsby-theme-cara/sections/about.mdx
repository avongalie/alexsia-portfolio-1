## About

> I'm passionate about coding and I know this is my dream.

I have been coding since 6th grade when I first came in contact with HTML. My love for code and computers sparked and I began to explore new languages and began pursing educational oppurtunites in line with CS. Now I am pursing a degree in Computer Systems at New York City College of Technology. As a young black woman, I don't see people like me representated enough in the field. I strive to become a role model and example for young woman who look like me.
